# calendar_app

Just to reinforce what I've been doing over the past few weeks on the Makers course with regards to sinatra/capybara/psql etc.


## User stories 

```
As a user,
So that I can remind myself of upcoming events,
I'd like to be able to add an event to a calendar.

As a user,
So that I can know when an event is near,
I'd like to be able to see the event on the calendar.

More to come I'm sure
```
